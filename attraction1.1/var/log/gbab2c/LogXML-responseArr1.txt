            [title] => Singapore Zoo Admission with Unlimited Tram Ride
            [address] => Mandai Lake Rd Singapore
            [description] => Since 1973, the Singapore Zoo has been proving that it is a must-visit, especially after winning the coveted Best Leisure Attraction Experience by the Singapore Tourism Board for nine times. Guests are free to explore the 62,000-square metre wildlife park located inside Mandai rainforest, a reserved part of Singapore that extends into the Upper Seletar reservoir. Today, the zoo serves as the home of over 2,800 animals that represent more than 300 species of reptiles, mammals, and birds combined.

As it is a reservation centre more than any, the Singapore Zoo has special viewing features for guests, so their visit wont disrupt the animals. These include high platforms, where guests can view the giraffe exhibit and underwater galleries. On the underwater galleries, one can see the giant estuarine crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and otters up close. Other features of the zoo include the Australian Outback, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and Wild Africa. This booking also gives the holder an unlimited tram ride pass, so visitors can comfortably check out the rest of the park onboard an in-house vehicle.

            [address] => malaysia tourism
            [description] => This hop-on, hop-off e-voucher valid for 24 hours enables the holder to go on a sightseeing tour in Kuala Lumpur for a whole day. Pass by the Petronas Twin Towers, which is a famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur. The twin skyscrapers were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Guests will also pass by attractions like the National Museum, Merdaka Square, KL Tower, Aquaria KLCC, National Mosque, Little India, and Chinatown, among others. Some of these attractions are situated very close to each other, so guests can hop off if they wish and visit them all, on own expense, in one go.

The bus gives ticket holders two options: they can sit inside the air-conditioned bus while listening to the tour guide or sit on the upper deck to take better pictures of the attractions that will be passed by.

            [address] => 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826
            [description] => Watch the river run while seeing pandas, manatees, and monkeys in these two boat rides at the Singapore River Safari. This admission ticket entitles the holder to two boat rides, the first being the Amazon River Quest. Built in the likelihood of its namesake, a boat ride here will take you through a South American rainforest. Guests can see around 30 different species on this area, providing a very similar feel to the second longest river in the world.

Once your 10-minute ride in the Amazon River Quest is done, you can proceed to the River Safari Cruise. Here, the gentle lapping of water, along with the rustling of trees, make for a good nature adventure. Depending on the time of visit, you may see herons, storks, and other wildlife animals during your ride. While these boat rides will take you to a lot of what River Safari has to offer, 85 percent of the wildlife park can only be reached by foot. That said, guests are encouraged to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes to enjoy the park.

            [address] => hong kong disney
            [description] => Cinderella Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, and Mad Hatter Tea Cups are just some of the rides that guests can find inside Hong Kong Disneyland, the first theme park located in the similarly named resort. With this e-ticket, guests can get direct admission to the park and explore all the attractions inside.

Seven themed areas make up the whole park: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.

The Main Street, USA of Hong Kong DIsneyland is almost similar to the one in Anaheim. This part of the park serves as the main point of entry for all guests. Though identically made, the one is Hong Kong is heavily influenced European immigrants. This can be seen in Plaza Inn and Market House Bakery.

Adventureland, on the other hand, is the part that covers the most land area. It is where guests can find Tarzan’s Treehouse and Jungle River Cruise. This is also where guests can watch the “Festival of the Lion King.”

Stitch Encounter and Autopia are some of the attractions in Tomorrowland, while the renowned Sleeping Beauty Castle is located in Fantasyland. On the western side of the park is Toy Story Land where the Woody, Rex, and the other characters from the movie with the same name can be found. 

Those who have the intent to stay a little longer in the park can watch Flights of Fantasy, a parade which is very much like Anaheim’s Disney on Parade.

                    [address] => Mandai Lake Rd Singapore
                    [description] => Since 1973, the Singapore Zoo has been proving that it is a must-visit, especially after winning the coveted Best Leisure Attraction Experience by the Singapore Tourism Board for nine times. Guests are free to explore the 62,000-square metre wildlife park located inside Mandai rainforest, a reserved part of Singapore that extends into the Upper Seletar reservoir. Today, the zoo serves as the home of over 2,800 animals that represent more than 300 species of reptiles, mammals, and birds combined.

As it is a reservation centre more than any, the Singapore Zoo has special viewing features for guests, so their visit wont disrupt the animals. These include high platforms, where guests can view the giraffe exhibit and underwater galleries. On the underwater galleries, one can see the giant estuarine crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and otters up close. Other features of the zoo include the Australian Outback, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and Wild Africa. This booking also gives the holder an unlimited tram ride pass, so visitors can comfortably check out the rest of the park onboard an in-house vehicle.

                    [description] => This hop-on, hop-off e-voucher valid for 24 hours enables the holder to go on a sightseeing tour in Kuala Lumpur for a whole day. Pass by the Petronas Twin Towers, which is a famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur. The twin skyscrapers were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Guests will also pass by attractions like the National Museum, Merdaka Square, KL Tower, Aquaria KLCC, National Mosque, Little India, and Chinatown, among others. Some of these attractions are situated very close to each other, so guests can hop off if they wish and visit them all, on own expense, in one go.

The bus gives ticket holders two options: they can sit inside the air-conditioned bus while listening to the tour guide or sit on the upper deck to take better pictures of the attractions that will be passed by.

                    [address] => 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826
                    [description] => Watch the river run while seeing pandas, manatees, and monkeys in these two boat rides at the Singapore River Safari. This admission ticket entitles the holder to two boat rides, the first being the Amazon River Quest. Built in the likelihood of its namesake, a boat ride here will take you through a South American rainforest. Guests can see around 30 different species on this area, providing a very similar feel to the second longest river in the world.

Once your 10-minute ride in the Amazon River Quest is done, you can proceed to the River Safari Cruise. Here, the gentle lapping of water, along with the rustling of trees, make for a good nature adventure. Depending on the time of visit, you may see herons, storks, and other wildlife animals during your ride. While these boat rides will take you to a lot of what River Safari has to offer, 85 percent of the wildlife park can only be reached by foot. That said, guests are encouraged to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes to enjoy the park.

                    [description] => Cinderella Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, and Mad Hatter Tea Cups are just some of the rides that guests can find inside Hong Kong Disneyland, the first theme park located in the similarly named resort. With this e-ticket, guests can get direct admission to the park and explore all the attractions inside.

Seven themed areas make up the whole park: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.

The Main Street, USA of Hong Kong DIsneyland is almost similar to the one in Anaheim. This part of the park serves as the main point of entry for all guests. Though identically made, the one is Hong Kong is heavily influenced European immigrants. This can be seen in Plaza Inn and Market House Bakery.

Adventureland, on the other hand, is the part that covers the most land area. It is where guests can find Tarzan’s Treehouse and Jungle River Cruise. This is also where guests can watch the “Festival of the Lion King.”

Stitch Encounter and Autopia are some of the attractions in Tomorrowland, while the renowned Sleeping Beauty Castle is located in Fantasyland. On the western side of the park is Toy Story Land where the Woody, Rex, and the other characters from the movie with the same name can be found. 

Those who have the intent to stay a little longer in the park can watch Flights of Fantasy, a parade which is very much like Anaheim’s Disney on Parade.

                    [description] => Trekking at Mount Batur presents both a good adventure and scene as it is an active volcano located between two calderas. On this activity, you will trek to Mount Batur to reach the peak just in time for sunrise.

As you have to be there before sunrise, pick-up times will vary. After getting picked up from your accommodation in Ubud, you will proceed to the base of the volcano to begin your trekking activity.

            [title] => Singapore Zoo Admission with Unlimited Tram Ride
            [address] => Mandai Lake Rd Singapore
            [description] => Since 1973, the Singapore Zoo has been proving that it is a must-visit, especially after winning the coveted Best Leisure Attraction Experience by the Singapore Tourism Board for nine times. Guests are free to explore the 62,000-square metre wildlife park located inside Mandai rainforest, a reserved part of Singapore that extends into the Upper Seletar reservoir. Today, the zoo serves as the home of over 2,800 animals that represent more than 300 species of reptiles, mammals, and birds combined.

As it is a reservation centre more than any, the Singapore Zoo has special viewing features for guests, so their visit wont disrupt the animals. These include high platforms, where guests can view the giraffe exhibit and underwater galleries. On the underwater galleries, one can see the giant estuarine crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and otters up close. Other features of the zoo include the Australian Outback, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and Wild Africa. This booking also gives the holder an unlimited tram ride pass, so visitors can comfortably check out the rest of the park onboard an in-house vehicle.

            [address] => malaysia tourism
            [description] => This hop-on, hop-off e-voucher valid for 24 hours enables the holder to go on a sightseeing tour in Kuala Lumpur for a whole day. Pass by the Petronas Twin Towers, which is a famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur. The twin skyscrapers were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Guests will also pass by attractions like the National Museum, Merdaka Square, KL Tower, Aquaria KLCC, National Mosque, Little India, and Chinatown, among others. Some of these attractions are situated very close to each other, so guests can hop off if they wish and visit them all, on own expense, in one go.

The bus gives ticket holders two options: they can sit inside the air-conditioned bus while listening to the tour guide or sit on the upper deck to take better pictures of the attractions that will be passed by.

            [title] => River Safari Admission with Two Boat Rides
            [address] => 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826
            [description] => Watch the river run while seeing pandas, manatees, and monkeys in these two boat rides at the Singapore River Safari. This admission ticket entitles the holder to two boat rides, the first being the Amazon River Quest. Built in the likelihood of its namesake, a boat ride here will take you through a South American rainforest. Guests can see around 30 different species on this area, providing a very similar feel to the second longest river in the world.

Once your 10-minute ride in the Amazon River Quest is done, you can proceed to the River Safari Cruise. Here, the gentle lapping of water, along with the rustling of trees, make for a good nature adventure. Depending on the time of visit, you may see herons, storks, and other wildlife animals during your ride. While these boat rides will take you to a lot of what River Safari has to offer, 85 percent of the wildlife park can only be reached by foot. That said, guests are encouraged to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes to enjoy the park.

            [address] => hong kong disney
            [description] => Cinderella Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, and Mad Hatter Tea Cups are just some of the rides that guests can find inside Hong Kong Disneyland, the first theme park located in the similarly named resort. With this e-ticket, guests can get direct admission to the park and explore all the attractions inside.

Seven themed areas make up the whole park: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.

The Main Street, USA of Hong Kong DIsneyland is almost similar to the one in Anaheim. This part of the park serves as the main point of entry for all guests. Though identically made, the one is Hong Kong is heavily influenced European immigrants. This can be seen in Plaza Inn and Market House Bakery.

Adventureland, on the other hand, is the part that covers the most land area. It is where guests can find Tarzan’s Treehouse and Jungle River Cruise. This is also where guests can watch the “Festival of the Lion King.”

Stitch Encounter and Autopia are some of the attractions in Tomorrowland, while the renowned Sleeping Beauty Castle is located in Fantasyland. On the western side of the park is Toy Story Land where the Woody, Rex, and the other characters from the movie with the same name can be found. 

Those who have the intent to stay a little longer in the park can watch Flights of Fantasy, a parade which is very much like Anaheim’s Disney on Parade.

                    [address] => Mandai Lake Rd Singapore
                    [description] => Since 1973, the Singapore Zoo has been proving that it is a must-visit, especially after winning the coveted Best Leisure Attraction Experience by the Singapore Tourism Board for nine times. Guests are free to explore the 62,000-square metre wildlife park located inside Mandai rainforest, a reserved part of Singapore that extends into the Upper Seletar reservoir. Today, the zoo serves as the home of over 2,800 animals that represent more than 300 species of reptiles, mammals, and birds combined.

As it is a reservation centre more than any, the Singapore Zoo has special viewing features for guests, so their visit wont disrupt the animals. These include high platforms, where guests can view the giraffe exhibit and underwater galleries. On the underwater galleries, one can see the giant estuarine crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and otters up close. Other features of the zoo include the Australian Outback, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and Wild Africa. This booking also gives the holder an unlimited tram ride pass, so visitors can comfortably check out the rest of the park onboard an in-house vehicle.

                    [description] => This hop-on, hop-off e-voucher valid for 24 hours enables the holder to go on a sightseeing tour in Kuala Lumpur for a whole day. Pass by the Petronas Twin Towers, which is a famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur. The twin skyscrapers were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Guests will also pass by attractions like the National Museum, Merdaka Square, KL Tower, Aquaria KLCC, National Mosque, Little India, and Chinatown, among others. Some of these attractions are situated very close to each other, so guests can hop off if they wish and visit them all, on own expense, in one go.

The bus gives ticket holders two options: they can sit inside the air-conditioned bus while listening to the tour guide or sit on the upper deck to take better pictures of the attractions that will be passed by.

                    [address] => 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826
                    [description] => Watch the river run while seeing pandas, manatees, and monkeys in these two boat rides at the Singapore River Safari. This admission ticket entitles the holder to two boat rides, the first being the Amazon River Quest. Built in the likelihood of its namesake, a boat ride here will take you through a South American rainforest. Guests can see around 30 different species on this area, providing a very similar feel to the second longest river in the world.

Once your 10-minute ride in the Amazon River Quest is done, you can proceed to the River Safari Cruise. Here, the gentle lapping of water, along with the rustling of trees, make for a good nature adventure. Depending on the time of visit, you may see herons, storks, and other wildlife animals during your ride. While these boat rides will take you to a lot of what River Safari has to offer, 85 percent of the wildlife park can only be reached by foot. That said, guests are encouraged to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes to enjoy the park.

                    [description] => Cinderella Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, and Mad Hatter Tea Cups are just some of the rides that guests can find inside Hong Kong Disneyland, the first theme park located in the similarly named resort. With this e-ticket, guests can get direct admission to the park and explore all the attractions inside.

Seven themed areas make up the whole park: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.

The Main Street, USA of Hong Kong DIsneyland is almost similar to the one in Anaheim. This part of the park serves as the main point of entry for all guests. Though identically made, the one is Hong Kong is heavily influenced European immigrants. This can be seen in Plaza Inn and Market House Bakery.

Adventureland, on the other hand, is the part that covers the most land area. It is where guests can find Tarzan’s Treehouse and Jungle River Cruise. This is also where guests can watch the “Festival of the Lion King.”

Stitch Encounter and Autopia are some of the attractions in Tomorrowland, while the renowned Sleeping Beauty Castle is located in Fantasyland. On the western side of the park is Toy Story Land where the Woody, Rex, and the other characters from the movie with the same name can be found. 

Those who have the intent to stay a little longer in the park can watch Flights of Fantasy, a parade which is very much like Anaheim’s Disney on Parade.

            [address] => Mandai Lake Rd Singapore
            [description] => Since 1973, the Singapore Zoo has been proving that it is a must-visit, especially after winning the coveted Best Leisure Attraction Experience by the Singapore Tourism Board for nine times. Guests are free to explore the 62,000-square metre wildlife park located inside Mandai rainforest, a reserved part of Singapore that extends into the Upper Seletar reservoir. Today, the zoo serves as the home of over 2,800 animals that represent more than 300 species of reptiles, mammals, and birds combined.

As it is a reservation centre more than any, the Singapore Zoo has special viewing features for guests, so their visit wont disrupt the animals. These include high platforms, where guests can view the giraffe exhibit and underwater galleries. On the underwater galleries, one can see the giant estuarine crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and otters up close. Other features of the zoo include the Australian Outback, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and Wild Africa. This booking also gives the holder an unlimited tram ride pass, so visitors can comfortably check out the rest of the park onboard an in-house vehicle.

            [address] => malaysia tourism
            [description] => This hop-on, hop-off e-voucher valid for 24 hours enables the holder to go on a sightseeing tour in Kuala Lumpur for a whole day. Pass by the Petronas Twin Towers, which is a famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur. The twin skyscrapers were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Guests will also pass by attractions like the National Museum, Merdaka Square, KL Tower, Aquaria KLCC, National Mosque, Little India, and Chinatown, among others. Some of these attractions are situated very close to each other, so guests can hop off if they wish and visit them all, on own expense, in one go.

The bus gives ticket holders two options: they can sit inside the air-conditioned bus while listening to the tour guide or sit on the upper deck to take better pictures of the attractions that will be passed by.

            [title] => River Safari Admission with Two Boat Rides
            [address] => 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826
            [description] => Watch the river run while seeing pandas, manatees, and monkeys in these two boat rides at the Singapore River Safari. This admission ticket entitles the holder to two boat rides, the first being the Amazon River Quest. Built in the likelihood of its namesake, a boat ride here will take you through a South American rainforest. Guests can see around 30 different species on this area, providing a very similar feel to the second longest river in the world.

Once your 10-minute ride in the Amazon River Quest is done, you can proceed to the River Safari Cruise. Here, the gentle lapping of water, along with the rustling of trees, make for a good nature adventure. Depending on the time of visit, you may see herons, storks, and other wildlife animals during your ride. While these boat rides will take you to a lot of what River Safari has to offer, 85 percent of the wildlife park can only be reached by foot. That said, guests are encouraged to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes to enjoy the park.

Those who have the intent to stay a little longer in the park can watch Flights of Fantasy, a parade which is very much like Anaheim’s Disney on Parade.

                    [address] => Mandai Lake Rd Singapore
                    [description] => Since 1973, the Singapore Zoo has been proving that it is a must-visit, especially after winning the coveted Best Leisure Attraction Experience by the Singapore Tourism Board for nine times. Guests are free to explore the 62,000-square metre wildlife park located inside Mandai rainforest, a reserved part of Singapore that extends into the Upper Seletar reservoir. Today, the zoo serves as the home of over 2,800 animals that represent more than 300 species of reptiles, mammals, and birds combined.

As it is a reservation centre more than any, the Singapore Zoo has special viewing features for guests, so their visit wont disrupt the animals. These include high platforms, where guests can view the giraffe exhibit and underwater galleries. On the underwater galleries, one can see the giant estuarine crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and otters up close. Other features of the zoo include the Australian Outback, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and Wild Africa. This booking also gives the holder an unlimited tram ride pass, so visitors can comfortably check out the rest of the park onboard an in-house vehicle.

                    [description] => This hop-on, hop-off e-voucher valid for 24 hours enables the holder to go on a sightseeing tour in Kuala Lumpur for a whole day. Pass by the Petronas Twin Towers, which is a famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur. The twin skyscrapers were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Guests will also pass by attractions like the National Museum, Merdaka Square, KL Tower, Aquaria KLCC, National Mosque, Little India, and Chinatown, among others. Some of these attractions are situated very close to each other, so guests can hop off if they wish and visit them all, on own expense, in one go.

The bus gives ticket holders two options: they can sit inside the air-conditioned bus while listening to the tour guide or sit on the upper deck to take better pictures of the attractions that will be passed by.

                    [address] => 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826
                    [description] => Watch the river run while seeing pandas, manatees, and monkeys in these two boat rides at the Singapore River Safari. This admission ticket entitles the holder to two boat rides, the first being the Amazon River Quest. Built in the likelihood of its namesake, a boat ride here will take you through a South American rainforest. Guests can see around 30 different species on this area, providing a very similar feel to the second longest river in the world.

Once your 10-minute ride in the Amazon River Quest is done, you can proceed to the River Safari Cruise. Here, the gentle lapping of water, along with the rustling of trees, make for a good nature adventure. Depending on the time of visit, you may see herons, storks, and other wildlife animals during your ride. While these boat rides will take you to a lot of what River Safari has to offer, 85 percent of the wildlife park can only be reached by foot. That said, guests are encouraged to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes to enjoy the park.

                    [description] => Cinderella Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, and Mad Hatter Tea Cups are just some of the rides that guests can find inside Hong Kong Disneyland, the first theme park located in the similarly named resort. With this e-ticket, guests can get direct admission to the park and explore all the attractions inside.

Seven themed areas make up the whole park: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.

The Main Street, USA of Hong Kong DIsneyland is almost similar to the one in Anaheim. This part of the park serves as the main point of entry for all guests. Though identically made, the one is Hong Kong is heavily influenced European immigrants. This can be seen in Plaza Inn and Market House Bakery.

Adventureland, on the other hand, is the part that covers the most land area. It is where guests can find Tarzan’s Treehouse and Jungle River Cruise. This is also where guests can watch the “Festival of the Lion King.”

Stitch Encounter and Autopia are some of the attractions in Tomorrowland, while the renowned Sleeping Beauty Castle is located in Fantasyland. On the western side of the park is Toy Story Land where the Woody, Rex, and the other characters from the movie with the same name can be found. 

Those who have the intent to stay a little longer in the park can watch Flights of Fantasy, a parade which is very much like Anaheim’s Disney on Parade.

            [title] => Singapore Zoo Admission with Unlimited Tram Ride
            [address] => Mandai Lake Rd Singapore
            [description] => Since 1973, the Singapore Zoo has been proving that it is a must-visit, especially after winning the coveted Best Leisure Attraction Experience by the Singapore Tourism Board for nine times. Guests are free to explore the 62,000-square metre wildlife park located inside Mandai rainforest, a reserved part of Singapore that extends into the Upper Seletar reservoir. Today, the zoo serves as the home of over 2,800 animals that represent more than 300 species of reptiles, mammals, and birds combined.

As it is a reservation centre more than any, the Singapore Zoo has special viewing features for guests, so their visit wont disrupt the animals. These include high platforms, where guests can view the giraffe exhibit and underwater galleries. On the underwater galleries, one can see the giant estuarine crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and otters up close. Other features of the zoo include the Australian Outback, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and Wild Africa. This booking also gives the holder an unlimited tram ride pass, so visitors can comfortably check out the rest of the park onboard an in-house vehicle.

            [address] => malaysia tourism
            [description] => This hop-on, hop-off e-voucher valid for 24 hours enables the holder to go on a sightseeing tour in Kuala Lumpur for a whole day. Pass by the Petronas Twin Towers, which is a famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur. The twin skyscrapers were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Guests will also pass by attractions like the National Museum, Merdaka Square, KL Tower, Aquaria KLCC, National Mosque, Little India, and Chinatown, among others. Some of these attractions are situated very close to each other, so guests can hop off if they wish and visit them all, on own expense, in one go.

The bus gives ticket holders two options: they can sit inside the air-conditioned bus while listening to the tour guide or sit on the upper deck to take better pictures of the attractions that will be passed by.

            [title] => River Safari Admission with Two Boat Rides
            [address] => 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826
            [description] => Watch the river run while seeing pandas, manatees, and monkeys in these two boat rides at the Singapore River Safari. This admission ticket entitles the holder to two boat rides, the first being the Amazon River Quest. Built in the likelihood of its namesake, a boat ride here will take you through a South American rainforest. Guests can see around 30 different species on this area, providing a very similar feel to the second longest river in the world.

Once your 10-minute ride in the Amazon River Quest is done, you can proceed to the River Safari Cruise. Here, the gentle lapping of water, along with the rustling of trees, make for a good nature adventure. Depending on the time of visit, you may see herons, storks, and other wildlife animals during your ride. While these boat rides will take you to a lot of what River Safari has to offer, 85 percent of the wildlife park can only be reached by foot. That said, guests are encouraged to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes to enjoy the park.

            [address] => hong kong disney
            [description] => Cinderella Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, and Mad Hatter Tea Cups are just some of the rides that guests can find inside Hong Kong Disneyland, the first theme park located in the similarly named resort. With this e-ticket, guests can get direct admission to the park and explore all the attractions inside.

Seven themed areas make up the whole park: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.

The Main Street, USA of Hong Kong DIsneyland is almost similar to the one in Anaheim. This part of the park serves as the main point of entry for all guests. Though identically made, the one is Hong Kong is heavily influenced European immigrants. This can be seen in Plaza Inn and Market House Bakery.

Adventureland, on the other hand, is the part that covers the most land area. It is where guests can find Tarzan’s Treehouse and Jungle River Cruise. This is also where guests can watch the “Festival of the Lion King.”

Stitch Encounter and Autopia are some of the attractions in Tomorrowland, while the renowned Sleeping Beauty Castle is located in Fantasyland. On the western side of the park is Toy Story Land where the Woody, Rex, and the other characters from the movie with the same name can be found. 

Those who have the intent to stay a little longer in the park can watch Flights of Fantasy, a parade which is very much like Anaheim’s Disney on Parade.

                    [address] => Mandai Lake Rd Singapore
                    [description] => Since 1973, the Singapore Zoo has been proving that it is a must-visit, especially after winning the coveted Best Leisure Attraction Experience by the Singapore Tourism Board for nine times. Guests are free to explore the 62,000-square metre wildlife park located inside Mandai rainforest, a reserved part of Singapore that extends into the Upper Seletar reservoir. Today, the zoo serves as the home of over 2,800 animals that represent more than 300 species of reptiles, mammals, and birds combined.

As it is a reservation centre more than any, the Singapore Zoo has special viewing features for guests, so their visit wont disrupt the animals. These include high platforms, where guests can view the giraffe exhibit and underwater galleries. On the underwater galleries, one can see the giant estuarine crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and otters up close. Other features of the zoo include the Australian Outback, Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and Wild Africa. This booking also gives the holder an unlimited tram ride pass, so visitors can comfortably check out the rest of the park onboard an in-house vehicle.

                    [description] => This hop-on, hop-off e-voucher valid for 24 hours enables the holder to go on a sightseeing tour in Kuala Lumpur for a whole day. Pass by the Petronas Twin Towers, which is a famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur. The twin skyscrapers were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004. Guests will also pass by attractions like the National Museum, Merdaka Square, KL Tower, Aquaria KLCC, National Mosque, Little India, and Chinatown, among others. Some of these attractions are situated very close to each other, so guests can hop off if they wish and visit them all, on own expense, in one go.

The bus gives ticket holders two options: they can sit inside the air-conditioned bus while listening to the tour guide or sit on the upper deck to take better pictures of the attractions that will be passed by.

                    [address] => 80 Mandai Lake Rd, Singapore 729826
                    [description] => Watch the river run while seeing pandas, manatees, and monkeys in these two boat rides at the Singapore River Safari. This admission ticket entitles the holder to two boat rides, the first being the Amazon River Quest. Built in the likelihood of its namesake, a boat ride here will take you through a South American rainforest. Guests can see around 30 different species on this area, providing a very similar feel to the second longest river in the world.

Once your 10-minute ride in the Amazon River Quest is done, you can proceed to the River Safari Cruise. Here, the gentle lapping of water, along with the rustling of trees, make for a good nature adventure. Depending on the time of visit, you may see herons, storks, and other wildlife animals during your ride. While these boat rides will take you to a lot of what River Safari has to offer, 85 percent of the wildlife park can only be reached by foot. That said, guests are encouraged to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes to enjoy the park.

                    [description] => Cinderella Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, and Mad Hatter Tea Cups are just some of the rides that guests can find inside Hong Kong Disneyland, the first theme park located in the similarly named resort. With this e-ticket, guests can get direct admission to the park and explore all the attractions inside.

Seven themed areas make up the whole park: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.

The Main Street, USA of Hong Kong DIsneyland is almost similar to the one in Anaheim. This part of the park serves as the main point of entry for all guests. Though identically made, the one is Hong Kong is heavily influenced European immigrants. This can be seen in Plaza Inn and Market House Bakery.

Adventureland, on the other hand, is the part that covers the most land area. It is where guests can find Tarzan’s Treehouse and Jungle River Cruise. This is also where guests can watch the “Festival of the Lion King.”

Stitch Encounter and Autopia are some of the attractions in Tomorrowland, while the renowned Sleeping Beauty Castle is located in Fantasyland. On the western side of the park is Toy Story Land where the Woody, Rex, and the other characters from the movie with the same name can be found. 

Those who have the intent to stay a little longer in the park can watch Flights of Fantasy, a parade which is very much like Anaheim’s Disney on Parade.
