To maximise your time with the photographer we highly recommend that you meet the photographer directly at your desired photo shoot location. Doing a photo shoot in multiple locations is possible but not recommended as you will lose time with your photographer travelling from one location to another.\r\n\r\n- Within 24 hours after your photo shoot, you will receive an email alert once the photographer has uploaded all photos into an online platform. You will be able to view all your photos and shortlist those you\u2019d like edited, and receive an email alert once editing is complete and high-resolution photos are ready for download.","covid19Measures":"","covid19MeasuresTranslated":"","priceIncludes":"","priceIncludesTranslated":"","priceExcludes":"","priceExcludesTranslated":"","validFrom":"","validThrough":"","itinerary":"","itineraryTranslated":"","warnings":"","warningsTranslated":"","safety":"","safetyTranslated":"","latitude":"-8.4095178","longitude":"115.1889160","address":"Bali, Indonesia","minPax":1,"maxPax":10,"basePrice":0,"currency":{"code":"SGD","symbol":"S$","uuid":"cd15153e-dfd1-5039-8aa3-115bec58e86e"},"isFlatPaxPrice":true,"reviewCount":0,"reviewAverageScore":0,"typeName":"Activity","tourType":"","typeUuid":"922c8611-609d-5f36-bb8a-f92c25e376a7","photosUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/playground.bemyguest.com.sg","businessHoursFrom":"","businessHoursTo":"","averageDelivery":"","hotelPickup":false,"airportPickup":false,"hasOptions":true,"allProductTypesHaveOptions":false,"photos":[{"caption":"","uuid":"4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166","paths":{"original":"\/images\/content\/original\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","75x50":"\/images\/content\/75x50\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","175x112":"\/images\/content\/175x112\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","680x325":"\/images\/content\/680x325\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","1280x720":"\/images\/content\/1280x720\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","1920x1080":"\/images\/content\/1920x1080\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","2048x1536":"\/images\/content\/2048x1536\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg"}},{"caption":"","uuid":"a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e","paths":{"original":"\/images\/content\/original\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","75x50":"\/images\/content\/75x50\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","175x112":"\/images\/content\/175x112\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","680x325":"\/images\/content\/680x325\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","1280x720":"\/images\/content\/1280x720\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","1920x1080":"\/images\/content\/1920x1080\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","2048x1536":"\/images\/content\/2048x1536\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg"}},{"caption":"","uuid":"9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d","paths":{"original":"\/images\/content\/original\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","75x50":"\/images\/content\/75x50\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","175x112":"\/images\/content\/175x112\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","680x325":"\/images\/content\/680x325\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","1280x720":"\/images\/content\/1280x720\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","1920x1080":"\/images\/content\/1920x1080\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","2048x1536":"\/images\/content\/2048x1536\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg"}}],"categories":[{"name":"Other","uuid":"44da13df-5772-4962-b370-3799ca14a0e5"},{"name":"Day tour","uuid":"8bf1af4c-cf52-5219-beb1-fe09d0812044"}],"locations":[{"city":"Bali","cityUuid":"ccb6876e-0686-5db9-aa73-a3104a3d27a3","state":"Bali","stateUuid":"ab348622-036d-11e5-a2a9-d07e352b4840","country":"Indonesia","countryUuid":"6d00a09f-f616-5c08-9007-edd20bfd11cc"}],"guideLanguages":[],"audioHeadsetLanguages":[],"writtenLanguages":[],"links":[{"method":"GET","rel":"self","href":"https:\/\/api.demo.bemyguest.com.sg\/v2\/products\/f3969abe-3cae-4b09-aec2-bb3f95dc77b1"},{"method":"GET","rel":"productTypes","href":"https:\/\/api.demo.bemyguest.com.sg\/v2\/products\/f3969abe-3cae-4b09-aec2-bb3f95dc77b1\/product-types"},{"method":"GET","rel":"docs","href":"https:\/\/bmglabsapi.docs.apiary.io\/reference\/products\/product"}],"translationLanguages":[],"isSrvEligible":false},"timestamp":"2023-08-23T17:49:44.258+08:00"}

To maximise your time with the photographer we highly recommend that you meet the photographer directly at your desired photo shoot location. Doing a photo shoot in multiple locations is possible but not recommended as you will lose time with your photographer travelling from one location to another.\r\n\r\n- Within 24 hours after your photo shoot, you will receive an email alert once the photographer has uploaded all photos into an online platform. You will be able to view all your photos and shortlist those you\u2019d like edited, and receive an email alert once editing is complete and high-resolution photos are ready for download.","covid19Measures":"","covid19MeasuresTranslated":"","priceIncludes":"","priceIncludesTranslated":"","priceExcludes":"","priceExcludesTranslated":"","validFrom":"","validThrough":"","itinerary":"","itineraryTranslated":"","warnings":"","warningsTranslated":"","safety":"","safetyTranslated":"","latitude":"-8.4095178","longitude":"115.1889160","address":"Bali, Indonesia","minPax":1,"maxPax":10,"basePrice":0,"currency":{"code":"SGD","symbol":"S$","uuid":"cd15153e-dfd1-5039-8aa3-115bec58e86e"},"isFlatPaxPrice":true,"reviewCount":0,"reviewAverageScore":0,"typeName":"Activity","tourType":"","typeUuid":"922c8611-609d-5f36-bb8a-f92c25e376a7","photosUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/playground.bemyguest.com.sg","businessHoursFrom":"","businessHoursTo":"","averageDelivery":"","hotelPickup":false,"airportPickup":false,"hasOptions":true,"allProductTypesHaveOptions":false,"photos":[{"caption":"","uuid":"4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166","paths":{"original":"\/images\/content\/original\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","75x50":"\/images\/content\/75x50\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","175x112":"\/images\/content\/175x112\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","680x325":"\/images\/content\/680x325\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","1280x720":"\/images\/content\/1280x720\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","1920x1080":"\/images\/content\/1920x1080\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg","2048x1536":"\/images\/content\/2048x1536\/4f25d9dd-54a2-47a7-9db3-bddb4cb40166.jpg"}},{"caption":"","uuid":"a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e","paths":{"original":"\/images\/content\/original\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","75x50":"\/images\/content\/75x50\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","175x112":"\/images\/content\/175x112\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","680x325":"\/images\/content\/680x325\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","1280x720":"\/images\/content\/1280x720\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","1920x1080":"\/images\/content\/1920x1080\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg","2048x1536":"\/images\/content\/2048x1536\/a795cb27-2c65-418b-bcf4-4fa35ec2ba1e.jpg"}},{"caption":"","uuid":"9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d","paths":{"original":"\/images\/content\/original\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","75x50":"\/images\/content\/75x50\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","175x112":"\/images\/content\/175x112\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","680x325":"\/images\/content\/680x325\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","1280x720":"\/images\/content\/1280x720\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","1920x1080":"\/images\/content\/1920x1080\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg","2048x1536":"\/images\/content\/2048x1536\/9de5ac0c-8581-41f3-8706-9b4abb09370d.jpg"}}],"categories":[{"name":"Other","uuid":"44da13df-5772-4962-b370-3799ca14a0e5"},{"name":"Day tour","uuid":"8bf1af4c-cf52-5219-beb1-fe09d0812044"}],"locations":[{"city":"Bali","cityUuid":"ccb6876e-0686-5db9-aa73-a3104a3d27a3","state":"Bali","stateUuid":"ab348622-036d-11e5-a2a9-d07e352b4840","country":"Indonesia","countryUuid":"6d00a09f-f616-5c08-9007-edd20bfd11cc"}],"guideLanguages":[],"audioHeadsetLanguages":[],"writtenLanguages":[],"links":[{"method":"GET","rel":"self","href":"https:\/\/api.demo.bemyguest.com.sg\/v2\/products\/f3969abe-3cae-4b09-aec2-bb3f95dc77b1"},{"method":"GET","rel":"productTypes","href":"https:\/\/api.demo.bemyguest.com.sg\/v2\/products\/f3969abe-3cae-4b09-aec2-bb3f95dc77b1\/product-types"},{"method":"GET","rel":"docs","href":"https:\/\/bmglabsapi.docs.apiary.io\/reference\/products\/product"}],"translationLanguages":[],"isSrvEligible":false},"timestamp":"2023-08-28T10:40:47.455+08:00"}
