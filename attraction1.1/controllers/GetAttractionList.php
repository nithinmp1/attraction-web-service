landmark in Singapore. Our mission is to explore where art, science, culture and technology come together. It is here at the intersection of art and science that innovation and new ideas are formed. We like to say “it’s where the future is created”.\n\nOur striking lotus-inspired building, designed by Moshe Safdie, features 21 gallery spaces spanning nearly 5000m2. Since opening in February 2011, we have held large-scale exhibitions by some of the world’s best known artists including Leonardo da Vinci, Salvador Dalí, Andy Warhol, Vincent Van Gogh and M.C. Escher. In addition, we have presented significant exhibitions that explore aspects of science including big data, particle physics, paleontology, marine biology, cosmology and space exploration.\n\nThe museum has staged international exhibitions in partnership with renowned museums and galleries from around the world including the British Museum and Science Museum in London; the American Museum of Natural History, New York; the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan; the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo; the Australian Centre for Moving Image, Melbourne and many other institutions. We also originate and produce exhibitions in-house and run a full programme of education, events, performances, screenings and learning opportunities for a wide range of audiences.\n\nArtScience Museum is owned and operated by Marina Bay Sands. It employs approximately 50 people directly, and is supported by many more, within the larger corporate structure of Marina Bay Sands.","hoursOfOperation":"Address: 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956\nDaily: 10:00am - 7:00pm\nIncluding public holidays\nLast admission at 6:00pm","title":"ArtScience Museum","attractionHighlights":[],"imagePathSecondary":"","lastUpdated":"2020-03-19T06:50:56Z","dateCreated":"2018-06-08T03:03:54Z","imagePathExt":"png","id":8966,"ticketTypeGroups":[{"code":"04","orderFulfillment":0,"requireReceiptCode":null,"applyCapacity":false,"isAdvanceSellingPeriod":false,"questions":[],"description":"- ArtScience Museum will be close from Tuesday 7 April 2020 until Tuesday 1 June 2020.\n- All visitors to ArtScience Museum will be required to undergo temperature screening and submit a short travel declaration form with their contact details before entering the museum.\n- Digital Light Canvas Information:\n1.

devoted to exploring the rich artistic heritage of Asia, especially the ancestral cultures of Singaporeans. Opened in 1997 and in its present building by the Singapore River since 2003, the museum traces its roots to the Raffles Museum, founded in the middle of the 19th century. ACM focuses on the many historical connections between the cultures of Asia, and between Asia and the world. Singapore’s history as a port city that brought people together from all over the world is used as a means of examining the history of Asia. Special exhibitions bring magnificent objects from around the world to our Singapore audience. Signature programmes like the annual ACM After Dark, Saturdays@ACM, and Lunchtime Concerts encourage visitors to connect more closely with culture and the arts.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.acm.org.sg/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily: 10am - 7pm\nFridays: 10am – 9pm\nAdmission to all galleries ends 15 minutes before closing time.","title":"Asian Civilisations Museum","attractionHighlights":[],"imagePathSecondary":"","lastUpdated":"2020-03-19T08:51:12Z","dateCreated":"2016-04-22T05:29:47Z","imagePathExt":"png","id":3,"ticketTypeGroups":[{"code":"03","orderFulfillment":0,"requireReceiptCode":null,"applyCapacity":false,"isAdvanceSellingPeriod":null,"questions":[],"description":"Special Exhibition – Guo Pei: Chinese Art and Couture will be valid from 15 June 2019  until 15 September 2019.

is the new sport in town! It is both a recreation and competitive sport where there are score points based on where you stick the axe in the target board. Think darts, but bigger and better!\nIS AXE THROWING SAFE? - Absolutely! Safety is our top priority here in Axe Factor, and we take any breach of safety seriously. We have specific set of rules and regulations for throwers to adhere to and have trained “Axe-pert” guiding you and your group while ensuring that the safety protocols are adhered to. We also have months of discussion with various organizations to set up the safety framework we have here. So, have a peace of mind and concentrate on the target!\nIS IT HARD TO THROW AN AXE? - No. It is more about the technique than strength. Once you stick your first bullseye, you will be hooked!\nHOW DOES IT WORK? - You can either throw alone or come with a group of friends (Of course it’s always better with friends!). Throwers are advised to book online before heading over, as walk-ins might not always be available. A simple safety brief will be given after the signing of waiver forms, together with instructions on how to safely throw and retrieve an axe. Throwers will then start off with practice throws guided by our “Axe-perts”, and once everyone gets the hang of it, there will be a round robin tournament followed by a final knock out round to determine who is the winner, and who gets to leave with bragging rights!","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday – Sunday: 12 pm to 10 pm\nClosed on Monday","title":"Axe Factor","attractionHighlights":[],"imagePathSecondary":"","lastUpdated":"2020-07-02T02:52:15Z","dateCreated":"2018-09-19T05:37:10Z","imagePathExt":"png","id":9615,"ticketTypeGroups":[{"code":"01","orderFulfillment":0,"requireReceiptCode":null,"applyCapacity":false,"isAdvanceSellingPeriod":false,"questions":[],"description":"- We are just 12 minutes walk away from Sixth Avenue MRT station!\n- Shuttle buses are also available for a direct route to our range.

of the speed and crowd in the city? Need a break? advenTOUR invites you and your loved ones for an unforgettable cycling adventure to enjoy a trail of nature. \n\nRevisit one of Singapore’s preserved islands as you are brought back into time to how our main island used to be 50 years ago. Your journey with us begins at Changi Point Ferry Terminal where you’ll take a short bumboat ride across the channel to the island of Pulau Ubin. \n\nChoose a bicycle from the range of rides we offer and peddle your way deep into the island as you immerse yourself into the nature and local culture available on the island. Don’t be surprised if you find wild boars crossing the road as you pedal through rustic roads under swaying coconut palms, exploring shady trails in overgrown rubber plantations, checking out secluded beaches and flourishing mangroves.\n\nLaser clay shooting is played with authentic, but de-activated 12-bore shotguns that fire infrared beams at reflective and reusable clays. The system is sound simulated- on fire, a realistic shotgun ‘bang’ is produced and hits are indicated by the sound of breaking clay. There is a scoreboard displaying the points scored by each gun. Up to 5 players can be playing at one time.\n\nThis can be enjoyed by people of all ages as it is completely safe, even for young children. It can be played just for fun, or as a serious competition. We have a range of shooting games that are designed to test the skills of both novice and experience shooters. This sport can be ideal for personal training development, birthday parties, corporate events and formal inter-organisation competitions.\n\nLaser Clay Shooting can be played indoors or outdoors. The venue should a minimum area of 30 x 10m as it is required to enable the clay to fly and land. The clay launcher can be adjusted to fire the clays at different heights and angles.\n\nZorbing has been a must-do activity for many adrenaline junkies visiting New Zealand but now, Singapore has it’s very own zorb service provider!\n\nThe sport can be enjoyed by all ages who don’t mind being strapped securely inside the capsule an enormous clear plastic, air-cushioned ball. All the violent bouncing is absorbed by the bigger outer transparent ball.\n\nAs the ball rolls down a long grass-covered slope, you spin around in a virtual anti-gravity form of weightlessness like an intoxicated space traveller. As you balance and walk in the ball, you may tumble head over heels, the build up of centrifugal force keeps you pressed hard against the plastic wall, so it’s easy to ‘go with the flow’ and enjoy the revolving view outside.","hoursOfOperation":"Available only on Sundays at 9am to 5pm.","title":"Exploration on Bicycles + Laser Clay Shooting + Land

management of the National Heritage Board and with support from the Indian community, traces the history of the Indian and South Asian communities in the Southeast Asian region.\n\nThe four-storey building is an iconic, unique and sustainable building that blends both traditional Indian as well as modern architectural elements. The architectural design for the facade is inspired by the baoli (or Indian stepwell), and seeks to create an urban forum for the celebration and appreciation of Indian culture. It houses five permanent galleries, a museum shop as well as programming and activity spaces.\n\nThe diversity and multi-faceted nature of Indian culture is also captured in the use of a translucent shimmering façade to create an impression of the Centre as a “shining jewel” in the day, and the transformation into a “glowing lantern” of the Indian community with the lighting of the colourful façade mural at night.\n\nSituated at 5 Campbell Lane, the Centre also serves as a springboard for visitors to explore Little India and enjoy the sights, sounds and scents of the historical precinct. Indian Heritage Centre was opened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 7 May 2015 and offers year-round exhibitions, programmes and activities to promote greater public awareness and appreciation of Indian heritage, arts and culture.","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesdays - Thursdays: 10.00am to 7.00pm\nFridays - Saturdays: 10.00am to 8.00pm\nSundays/Public Holidays* : 10.00am to 4.00pm\nClosed on Mondays\n* The Indian Heritage Centre is closed on Public Holidays that fall on a Monday unless otherwise stated.

strapped safely inside the ball before being sent rolling head over heels downhill. Land ZOVBing is definitely be lots of screams and laughters along the way. Be sure to empty your pockets before getting strapped on as we have occasions where “money drops from the sky” – for your partner of course, when the loose change escapes from the pockets. Once you reach the bottom of the slope, you will be given a chance to live like a hamster and experience the torment of running in the ZOVB ball back up the hill. Not a simple task as some might imagine as it requires a certain degree of coordination and willpower to go run back up the slope. Sounds like fun eh?        \n\nYou can also do additional racing games in the ZOVB Balls or even Human Bowling in ZOVB! It is more fun when it’s human sized! In our Land ZOVB version, you can get into the ZOVB balls and attempt to knock down the human sized bowling pins or be on the outside to roll the Land ZOVB Balls. \n\n\"Laser clay shooting is played with authentic, but de-activated 12-bore shotguns that fire infrared beams at reflective and reusable clays. The system is sound simulated- on fire, a realistic shotgun ‘bang’ is produced and hits are indicated by the sound of breaking clay. There is a scoreboard displaying the points scored by each gun. Up to 5 players can be playing at one time.\n\nThis can be enjoyed by people of all ages as it is completely safe, even for young children. It can be played just for fun, or as a serious competition. We have a range of shooting games that are designed to test the skills of both novice and experience shooters. This sport can be ideal for personal training development, birthday parties, corporate events and formal inter-organisation competitions.\n\nLaser Clay Shooting can be played indoors or outdoors. The venue should a minimum area of 30 x 10m as it is required to enable the clay to fly and land. The clay launcher can be adjusted to fire the clays at different heights and angles.","hoursOfOperation":"Daily","title":"Land ZOVBing + Laser Clay Shooting","attractionHighlights":[],"imagePathSecondary":null,"lastUpdated":"2020-04-29T09:36:59Z","dateCreated":"2020-04-27T11:16:49Z","imagePathExt":"png","id":20998,"ticketTypeGroups":[{"code":"00","orderFulfillment":0,"requireReceiptCode":false,"applyCapacity":false,"isAdvanceSellingPeriod":null,"questions":[],"description":"-  Activities are held every Wednesday and Sunday from 4pm-5.30pm at big field along Old Holland Road.

All the violent bouncing is absorbed by the bigger outer transparent ball.\n\nAs the ball rolls down a long grass-covered slope, you spin around in a virtual anti-gravity form of weightlessness like an intoxicated space traveller.

The experience begins from Chinatown MRT Station Exit A in the evening where everyone will board the fun bus and start the journey to eating scrumptious local cuisine. \n\nA few cuisines that our friends and colleagues might be trying would be Local BBQ seafood, Satay, Hainanese Chicken Rice, local desserts and Drinks. The menu is just a yardstick to begin with; customisations are open for discussions depending on the budget. \n\nThis activity is recommended for organisations that have inbound guests for APAC or general meetings for that matter where part of the experience would be to introduce them to local Singapore. Drop us a note for more information on how to get your taste buds running.","hoursOfOperation":"Held every Wednesday and Sunday from 4pm.","title":"Land ZOVBing + Laser Clay Shooting + Food Experience","attractionHighlights":[],"imagePathSecondary":null,"lastUpdated":"2020-05-09T06:57:10Z","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T09:45:06Z","imagePathExt":"png","id":21001,"ticketTypeGroups":[{"code":"00","orderFulfillment":0,"requireReceiptCode":false,"applyCapacity":false,"isAdvanceSellingPeriod":null,"questions":[],"description":"- Activities are held every Wednesday and Sunday from 4pm.

a history dating back to 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation’s oldest museum with a progressive mind.

A cultural and architectural landmark in Singapore, journey through 700 years of Singapore&#39;s history and explore over 1,700 historical and cultural artefacts at the museum’s permanent galleries such as Singapore History Gallery, Life in Singapore: The Past 100 Years Galleries, and Goh Seng Choo Gallery.\n\nThe Singapore History Gallery charts the development of the island as it was known through the years as Singapura, Crown Colony, Syonan-To, and finally, Singapore. Spanning the last 100 years, four galleries in The Life in Singapore Galleries – Modern Colony, Surviving Syonan, Growing Up and Voices of Singapore, present snapshots of everyday life in different decades of Singapore’s history.  The Goh Seng Choo Gallery features a selection of drawings from the museum’s prized William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings that highlights the rich natural history of Southeast Asia.","hoursOfOperation":"Address: 93 Stamford Road, Singapore 178897\nDaily 10am to 7pm. \nLast admission:\n(1.) 6.15pm (Glass Rotunda)\n(2.) 6.30pm (All other galleries)","title":"National Museum Of Singapore","attractionHighlights":[],"imagePathSecondary":"","lastUpdated":"2020-03-16T03:45:52Z","dateCreated":"2017-03-13T06:25:39Z","imagePathExt":"png","id":575,"ticketTypeGroups":[{"code":"02","orderFulfillment":0,"requireReceiptCode":null,"applyCapacity":false,"isAdvanceSellingPeriod":null,"questions":[],"description":"Free admission from 25 to 27 January 2020 as part of our Chinese New Year Open House celebrations\n\nYour order is confirmed.

3 Attractions (out of 232 Attractions) in Fun & Games Category in TripAdvisor\n\nIf youve heard of escape rooms but not sure what it really is, dont worry. Youre not alone. Picture this, you’re kidnapped and trapped in a room with your peers, and there seems to be almost no way out. Become the master at solving puzzles, discovering hidden messages, and unwrapping mysteries to successfully escape our well thought and creative concept rooms. You may need to do unconventional things to progress in the game such as crawling into a tunnel, rhythmic tapping on a surface to unlock the passageway to a secret chamber, and many more.\n\n*Game:The Mental Ward\nIt is your first day as an intern in the Mental Hospital. During your lunch break, you and your colleagues decide to explore the codorned ward. Rumour has it, the most notorious mental patients were in that ward before it was shut down. You have an hour to find out if the rumours you heard about the ward are true, before you have to report back to your superior.\nDifficulty Level: 94%\nIntensity Level: 86%\nGroup Size: 2 to 10 Pax (Recommended team size of 8 players)\nAttire: Any\nThis theme room is suitable for all ages but there may be scary props and mysteries to solve.\n\n*Game:Tekong Army Bunk\nYou have been sent by your commanding chief to Tekong Island to find out why the commanding officer there has not been responding to HQ.

If you manage to solve them, they will grant you freedom, otherwise when the hour is up, Purge Night begins and so does their crime spree! \nDifficulty Level: 83%\nIntensity Level: 90%\nGroup Size: 2 to 10 Pax (Recommended team size of 8 players)\nAttire: Any\nThis theme room is suitable for all ages as it is a kidnapped themed game.
